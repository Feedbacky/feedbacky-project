### Creating own instance
Minimum requirements and setup tutorial can be found at [our official wiki](https://docs.feedbacky.net).

## Further customizing
If you want you can customize your Feedbacky instance even more.
You can edit [this file](https://github.com/Plajer/feedbacky-project/blob/master/client/public/index.html) to add for example
your own OG meta tags like
![](https://static.plajer.xyz/feedbacky/img/og-example.png)

Mail templates can be edited [in this folder](https://github.com/Plajer/feedbacky-project/tree/master/server/src/main/resources/mail_templates).

## Updating from older versions
This section will contain information about variables you need to put to .env file to make Feedbacky work after you update it.
It might include other information as well. 

### Updating to 0.2.0
**!!!** New `.env` variables were added and are required to start, add them to the file and save:
```
MAIL_SENDGRID_API_KEY=apiKey
MAIL_SENDGRID_API_BASE_URL=baseUrl
```
If you don't plan to use SendGrid as a mail provider there is no need to modify these values.

Roadmaps were added in this version but Hibernate will automagically include it in database.
Migrator will migrate every user automatically to enable mail preferences for a new Mail Notifications feature.

**!!!** When using Mailgun as a mail provider add `/messages` at the end of `MAIL_MAILGUN_API_BASE_URL` env variable,
we no longer add this part in code.
